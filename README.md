_______________________________
**Background**


_______________________________
The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  The dataset reveals a small handful of microbial species (also called OTUs, or operational taxonomic units) that were present in more than 70% of the subjects, while the rest were relatively rare.

**Objective**


_______________________________
Build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset that will display the following:

* A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown meny to display the top 10 OTUs found in that subject
* Create a bubble chart that displays each sample, using the subject's sample values for the marker size and the OTU ids for the marker colors
* Display the sample metadata for that subject using the key-value pairs from the JSON object
* Update all of the plots any time a new subject is selected
